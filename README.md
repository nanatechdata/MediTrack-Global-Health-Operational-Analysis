MediTrack Global Health operates across ten countries, serving thousands of patients.
Their biggest challenge wasn’t the data itself…
it was the lack of a clear, connected picture of what was happening across financials, operations, and patient care.

Tools That Brought This Project to life;

- Power BI for building interactive visuals
- Power Query (M Language) to clean and transform raw data
- DAX for dynamic KPIs used in clinical and operational decisions

Recommendations That Could Strengthen Decision-Making

To support MediTrack in improving efficiency, care quality, and operational flow, I highlighted a few key actions:

✔️ Streamline claims and reimbursement processes
Outstanding claims of $3.2M slow down financial health — tightening this workflow can increase available resources for patient care.

✔️ Enhance post-discharge support
A 9.75% readmission rate suggests patients need stronger follow-up programs, better education, and more personalized aftercare.

✔️ Balance patient load across hospitals
Some facilities are over-capacity while others underutilized. Redirecting non-urgent cases can improve wait times and reduce staff strain.

✔️ Improve capacity planning during peak months
Admissions and operational demand fluctuate — predictive planning can ensure staffing and resources meet seasonal needs.

✔️ Invest more attention in high-risk departments
Units like Oncology and Neurology show higher mortality trends and need added support, deeper analysis, and more targeted resources.

✨ Dashboards like this don’t just show numbers…they support the nurses, doctors, admin teams, billing teams, and clinicians behind the scenes and by bringing data into healthcare it really helps them serve better, respond faster, and care smarter.
